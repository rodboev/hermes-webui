"""Regression tests for issue #3587: intermediate assistant message reasoning lost.

During multi-turn streaming (assistant reasons → calls tool → reasons again →
responds), the flat _reasoning_text accumulator was written only to the LAST
assistant message on settlement. Intermediate assistant messages (before tool
calls) permanently lost their reasoning traces.

Fix: replace the flat accumulator with a per-message dict (_reasoning_segments),
track assistant message transitions via on_interim_assistant, and iterate forward
through s.messages on settlement so each assistant message receives its own
reasoning segment.
